What is the equilibrium condition?
Save the state when the different bilayer are equilibriated
    For each simulation model, have mostly lipid and have only one special lipid (samelength and properties as the others, but with a special name)
    For each of the simulation at equilibrium, write somewhere the number of lipid and the position of the bilayer
    
grep -A 1 "Bilayer Surface Tension" dmpcas.lp6_eq > lipid6.tmp

lp4 delta Z = 7.6 - 8.2
lp6 delta Z = 8.5 - 9.3
lp8 delta Z = 10.3 - 11.2
lp10 delta Z = 13 -13.5
